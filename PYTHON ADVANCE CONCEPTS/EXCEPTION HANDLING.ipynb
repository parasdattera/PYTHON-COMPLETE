    "\n",
    "* exception is an event occurs during execution of a program which disrupts normal flow of program\n",
    "* exception handling is process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions\n",
    "* terms used while handling exceptions:\n",
    "                    1. try - try block will have code that might have an exception\n",
    "                    2. except - if exception is in try block then this block will execute\n",
    "                    3. else - if no exceptions in try block this will be executed after try block\n",
    "                    4. finally - this block will be executed whether try has exception or not\n",
    "\n",
    "* raising an exception  -- using \"raise Exception\" keyword -- used when as a coder you know that in a specific block there\n",
    "                    might be an exception that can occur\n",
    "\n",
    "                    raise Exception('there is an exception in program!!')\n",
    "\n",
    "* instead of using try except block we can use \"assert\" keyword (it will stop execution of program if exception occur)\n",
    "                    so thats why it should be in try block \n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    assert (code),\"msg if exception\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* using try and except keyword with python built in exception handling keywords\n",
    "                    such as SyntaxError -- if syntax error in code\n",
    "                            IndentationError -- if there is an indextation error in code\n",
    "                            NameError -- if variable not found\n",
    "                            TypeError -- when there is an inappropriate type of variable\n",
    "                            more sample are -- ValueError,ZeroDivisionError,IndexError,KeyError,FileNotFoundError\n",
